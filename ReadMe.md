Natours App Project Description:

Natours App is a web application designed to offer users a seamless experience when exploring and booking tours to natural destinations worldwide. The platform provides detailed information about various tour packages, including descriptions, prices, difficulty levels, and duration. Users can easily browse and filter through available tours, book their desired trips, and leave reviews after their experiences.

The backend of the Natours App is built using Node.js and Express, offering a fast and scalable environment for handling server-side operations. MongoDB (NoSQL) is used for data management, allowing flexibility in storing user information, bookings, reviews, and tour details. The platform also utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain features like booking or review submissions.

Natours App aims to make the process of discovering and booking outdoor adventures effortless, while also providing a secure and user-friendly environment.</p>
